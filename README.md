# PY2106: An Introduction to Astrophysics and Special Relativity

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mkenne15/PY2106/main)

**Module Objective**: To introduce students to a variety of topics in astronomy and special relativity.

**Module Content**: Celestial coordinate systems, parallax distance determination, the virial theorem; orbits, tidal forces, formation and structure of the solar system, blackbody radiation; Doppler shifts of spectral lines, special relativity & astrophysical applications (cosmic rays, astrophysical jets).

**Learning Outcomes**: On successful completion of this module, students should be able to:

1. Show familiarity with equatorial celestial coordinates, parallax distance determination and the magnitude brightness scale,
2. know the virial theorem and how to apply it, including an ability to identify situations where it is not applicable,
3. Show familiarity with Newton's shell theorem and how to apply it in astrophysical problems,
4. Show familiarity with the properties of elliptical, parabolic and hyperbolic orbits and their relationship to the total energy and angular momentum of an orbiting body,
5. Explain the origin of tidal forces and their various consequences for orbiting bodies,
6. Demonstrate knowledge of the basic properties of the solar system and theories for its formation and structure,
7. Demonstrate an understanding of the properties of blackbody radiation and the distinction between thermal/non-thermal radiation,
8. Explain the origin of spectral line emission, Doppler line shifts and line-broadening mechanisms,.

**Assessment**: Total Marks 100: Formal Written Examination 80 marks; Continuous Assessment 20 marks (10 assignments, 2 marks each).

**Compulsory Elements**: Formal Written Examination; Continuous Assessment.

**Penalties (for late submission of Course/Project Work etc.)**: Work which is submitted late shall be assigned a mark of zero (or a Fail Judgement in the case of Pass/Fail modules).

**Pass Standard and any Special Requirements for Passing Module**: 40%.

**Formal Written Examination**: 1 x 1.5 hr(s) paper(s) to be taken in Summer 2022.

**Requirements for Supplemental Examination**: 1 x 1.5 hr(s) paper(s) to be taken in Autumn 2022. The mark for Continuous Assessment is carried forward.
