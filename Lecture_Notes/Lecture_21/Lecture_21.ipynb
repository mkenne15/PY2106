    "In this lecture, we're going to discuss how the concepts of special relativity affect the Doppler shift, which was introduced previously in this course. We'll start by considering general time intervals, then reconsider this in the contact of the frequency and wavelength of light. Finally, we'll quickly show that what we've derived reduces to the expected clssical Doppler shift for low velocities."

    "## The Doppler Factor\n",
    "Consider some light source that is moving at an angle to our line of sight. We're going to set up our frames such that we are in the **S** frame, and that **S'** moves in the same direction and with the same speed as the light source, such that the source is at rest in the primed frame. This source emits two photons, at time $t_1$ and $t_2$. I've sketched this setup below. Note that this differs a little bit from what I did in the lectures, but I think this is easier to follow\n",

    "In the time interval between the emission of the photons in our frame, the source will have moved a distance of $u\\Delta t$. Since the photons are emitted at the same x' coordinate in the frame of the source, we only have to worry about time dialation for this conversion, meaning the source has moved a distance of $\\gamma u\\Delta t'$, where $t'$ is the time between the emission of the two photons as measured in the frame of the source. Thus, photon two has an extra bit of distance it needs to cover before it reaches us compared to photon one, given by $\\gamma u\\Delta t' \\cos(\\theta)$. The time taken to cover this extra distance is $\\gamma \\frac{u}{c}\\Delta t' \\cos(\\theta)$. Thus, the time interval between both photons arriving at Earth is given by the time dialation moving between both frames and the extra time taken by photon 2 to travel this additional distance - that is\n",
