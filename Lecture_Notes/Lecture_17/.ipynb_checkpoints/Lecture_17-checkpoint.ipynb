    "## Earth\n",
    "Let's very quickly consider the Earth\n",

    "    T_{\\rm Earth} = \\frac{1}{2^{1/4}} T_{\\odot}\\sqrt {\\frac{R_{\\odot}}{d_{\\rm \\oplus}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which gives $T_{\\rm Earth}=333$ k or 60$^{\\rm o}$ celsius. That maybe runs a bit high (especially since it's an average, not a maximum), so what assumptions do you think we'd need to properly adjust for this?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "Not all of the light incident on the Earth is absorbed - the ocean and our atmosphere reflect some incident radiation. The fraction reflected is given by the albedo, $a$, of a planet. For Earth, $a \\sim 0.30$. We can account for this using:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    P_{\\rm abs} = (1-a)\\frac{L_{\\odot}}{4 \\pi d_{\\rm min}^2} \\pi R_{\\rm \\oplus} ^2\n",

    "$$\n",
    "which gives a temperature of $T_{\\rm \\oplus}=304.6$ k or 31.6$^{\\rm o}$ C. So much better already!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Redistribution of energy\n",
    "There are other effects, such as \n",
    "- The continous rotation of Earth. This means the surface exposure to radiation is constantly changing, which will help lower the temperature.\n",
    "- The atmosphere and oceans circulate, which spreads heat energy absorbed around a much larger fraction of the planet than we've used. This will also lower the temperature.\n",
    "- Internal energy of the planey due to cooling since formation helps increase the temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, as a first order approxmiation, we could say that the first 2 effects mean that the energy absorbed by the Earth is in fact spread over the entire surface of the planet. This means\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    P_{\\rm rad} = \\sigma (4 \\pi R_{\\rm \\oplus}^2) T_{\\rm \\oplus}^4\n",

    "$$\n",
    "    T_{\\rm \\oplus} = \\left( 1-a \\right)^{1/4} T_{\\odot}\\sqrt {\\frac{R_{\\odot}}{2 d_{\\rm \\oplus}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This then gives a temperature of $T_{\\rm \\oplus}=256$ k or -17$^{\\rm o}$ C. Which is way too cool - so we've likely overcompensated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greenhouse Effect\n",
    "Earth's atmosphere traps some absorbed energy near Earth's surface (\"Greenhouse effect\"). This raises the Earth's temperature to around 15$^{\\rm o}$ C."

    "## Atmospheres\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in the previous section, we were discussing the temperatures planets may have due to heating by the Sun, and one of the critical elements which affected the calculation of the temperature was the inclusion of an atmosphere. So, let's consider what atmosphere's planets may have.\n",
