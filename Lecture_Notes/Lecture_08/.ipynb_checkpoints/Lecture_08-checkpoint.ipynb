    "# Doppler broadening continued\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lecture, we saw that the distribution of velocities of particles in gas broadens the absorption/emission feature, and that the shape of this broadening is a Gaussian with the form\n",
    "$$\n",
    "     I(\\nu) = I_0 \\exp \\left[ - \\left(\\frac{c(\\nu-\\nu_0)}{\\nu_0 v_{\\rm max}}\\right)^2 \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $v_{\\rm max}$ is the velocity which is most probable to occur in a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is other types of motion which can give rise to Doppler broadening of a line. This is mainly due to rotation. Imagine we have a body rotating as shown below.\n",

    "![Doppler_Shift](Figures/Doppler_Rotation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The width of the line due to this rotation is simply given by\n",

    "    \\frac{\\delta \\lambda}{\\lambda} = \\frac{2 v_{\\rm rot, max}} {c} = \\frac{4\\pi R }{P c}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $v_{\\rm rot, max}$ is the maximum rotational velocity of the object (so at the equator), and $P$ is the rotational period of the object.\n",

    "Finally, there can also be turbulent broadening of the line, which involves the chaotic, bulk motions of gas rather than random motions within the gas.\n",

    "# Collisional/Pressure Broadening\n",
    "The final effect on absorption/emission features that we are going to talk about is collisional/pressure broadening. This is when we take into account what effect impacts between atoms have on their energy levels (recall the change in effective potential during scattering discussed in PY2101. The difference in the terms are\n",
    "1. Collisional Broadening is when each individual collision is considered.\n",
    "2. Pressure Broadening is when the statistical effect of many collisions is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this broadening is very similar to natural broadening. However, a key difference is that this effect depends on the number density of particles in the environment, since this is related to the number of expected collisions which should occur. As such, this effect is stronger in dense environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get an estimate of the expected width of a collisional broadened line, we can lean on the result from natural line broadening. First, we are going to assume that every collision results in a particle being removed from an excited state. The mean time between collisions, $\\delta t_0$, will now replace the time uncertainty we used in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle when considering natural broadening. Hence, we get that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\delta \\lambda  \\geq  \\frac{\\lambda^2}{2\\pi c \\delta t_0}\n",

    "The mean time between collisions is given by\n",

    "    \\delta t_0 = \\frac{l}{v}\n",

    "So what is the mean free path, $l$? Consider a particle which is travelling at a velocity $v$ in a gas, as shown below. If we define the maximum separation at which we expect an interaction to occur between this particle and any other particle to be $R$, then as the particle travels through the gas, it carves out a cylinder of volume $V=\\sigma x$. $\\sigma$ is known as the cross sectional area of the particle, and is given by $\\sigma=\\pi R^2$. If any particle falls within the area $\\sigma$ as our particle moves, we would expect an interaction. For clarity, I have coloured the particles we expect an interaction to occur with as green, and those for which no interaction is expected as red.\n",

    "So, in the end, if we neglect Doppler effects, we would expect any line to be broadened due to two components - the natural broadening, and the pressure broadening, both of which can be used to give us physical insight into what's occuring within the medium that is either producing the absorption or emission features."
