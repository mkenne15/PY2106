    "## Spectral classifiations\n",
    "### By Temperature\n",
    "The observed characteristics of stars led to 2 classification schemes in the late 1800's. The first scheme, by Pickering and Fleming related to the strength of the Balmer absorption features of hydrogen, with stars ranked from A (strongest absorption features) to O (weakest absorption features). However, a quick discussion of when we would expect to see Balmer absorption features will show why this order is not particularly. The Balmer absorption features are associated with electrons in the $n=2$ state absorbing photons. Thus, for cold objects, we do not expect to see strong features at these wavelengths, as there will not be many atoms with electrons in this state. As $T$ increases, more H atoms will have electrons in this state, leading to stronger absorption features. However, once hot enough, many of the H atoms will become ionised, leading to a decrease again in this absorption feature. These two competing effects lead to a maximum expected absorption depth at $T=10,000$ K. Thus, if we rank stars by the depth of their H features, then stars with temperatures close to $10,000$ K will be $A$, with both colder and hotter stars then categorised between B-O.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was realised by astronomers at Harvard, led by Annie Cannon, at the start of the 20th century, and the order reshuffled to **OBAFGKM**, such that all the labelling work done by Fleming could be maintained, but such that the stars were now ordered by their temperatures. These stars spanned a temperature range of $40,000 - 3000$ K. Since this time, we have added 2 new classifications to the system: L and T dwarfs (why do you think we didn't know of these stars at the time?).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are further subdivisions to this ordering, such that each letter is subdivided into 9 numbers. That is, G stars can be G1-G9, with G1 the hottest and G9 the coolest. The below table summarises the temperatures for the different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class | Temperature (K) |\n",
    "| --- | --- | \n",
    "| O | 40,000 |\n",
    "| B | 20,000 |\n",

    "| M | 3,000 |\n",
    "| L | 2,000 |\n",
    "| T | <1,300 |\n",
    "\n",
    "### By Luminosity\n",
    "The above classifications only rely on an objects temperature, but there is another classification we need to recall - luminosity! The six luminosity classes are given as Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, V, VI), and are assigned empircally on the width of a stars absorption features (I having the narrowest and VI having the widest) - this was first performed by yet another Harvard astrophysicst - Antonia Maury. We'll talk about this more in another lecture, but it turns out the luminosity class is related to the radius of the object, such that large objects have the most narrow lines, and small objects have broader lines.\n",

There is remarkable structure to this plot, which is worth discussing in significant detail.\n",

The x-axis is a proxy for temperature, with hot objects on the right and cold objects on the left, and the y-axis is a proxy for radius, with large giants towards the top and small dwarfs on the bottom. The diagonal strip that runs from the upper left to the lower right defines the main sequence - these are hydrogen burning stars like the Sun."
