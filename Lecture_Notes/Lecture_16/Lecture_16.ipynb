    "In the previous lecture, we discussed how observational quantites (magnitude, distance, colour) can be translated into physical quantites (masses, radii, temperatures). However, in doing this, we never discussed what part of a star we are actually viewing when we take a spectrum, or take some photometry. It's important to figure this out, as the  The goal of the first part of this lecture is to shed light (pun intended!) on this topic.\n",

    "When discussion photons, a similar expression exists, where $\\sigma$ represents the cross sectional area for photons undergoing absorption or scattering. The **optical depth** $\\tau$ is defined as 1 over this value:\n",

For $\\tau \\ll 1$, then the light is not attunated by the medium, and the medium is referred to as optically thin. If $\\tau \\gg 1$, then the medium is optically thick. \n",
    "\n",
    "When applying this to stars, it means that the inner parts of the star are optically thick, meaning we don't see the light coming from these regions. As you progress outwards from the Suns core, eventually either $n$ or $x$ become small enough that the optical depth drops below 1, in which case the medium becomes optically thin. It is from this region that light is emitted, and which we then observe with our telescopes. This region is called the photosphere. Now, let's use this information to understand both how large the photosphere is, and how this decides a stars luminosity class. \n",

    "Imagine we have a spherical star that is in hydrostatic equilibrium, where the inward force of gravity is balanced by the outward force due to the internal pressure of the object. The pressure gradient for such an object is given by\n",

First, let's use the standard definitions for elements that astronomers use: we care about hydrogen, helium, and metals (everything heavier than helium).

    "For a pure helium gas which is completely neutrl, then $n=\\rho/(4m_p)$ and $\\mu = 4$. If the gas is completely ionised, we triple the number of particles, as two electrons are freed from each atom, meaning $n=3\\rho/(4m_p)$ and $\\mu = 4/3$.\n",

    "For a gas made purely of metals, we will write $A$ as the average number of nucleons per atom. The number density is $n=\\rho/(A m_p)$ and the mean molecular mass is $\\mu = 4$ when neutral. If the number of protons and neutrons in each nucleas is roughly equal, then $\\sim A/2$ electrons will be freed when the gas is fully ionised, meaning the number density is $n\\approx\\rho/(2 m_p)$ and the mean molecular mass is $\\mu \\approx 2$, if $A/2 \\gg 1$.\n",

    "## Luminosity classes and pressure relation\n",
