For example, Jupiter absorbs $P=3.8\\times10^{17}$ W, but at infrared wavelengths, radiates twice this amount of power. So where is this coming from? To figure out why Gas Giants show this, and terrestrial planets do not, let's think about the energy that was released by the gravitational collapse of the disc in to the planets, and how long it should take for bodies to dissipate this heat:\n",

    "\n",
    "Jupiter's heat production can be explained in this way - that is, the excess we see matches what we'd expect from this cooling time for an object of Jupiter's radius. However, Saturn's heat production is too high.\n",
    "- The most likely explanation is that the excess heat in Saturn is generated through the action of the virial theorem continus as He sinks slowly through the H$_2$ atmosphere."
