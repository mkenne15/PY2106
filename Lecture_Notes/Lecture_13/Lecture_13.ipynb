    "All planets produce heat due to the decay of radioactive nuclei, including the terrestrial planets, but the Gas Giants show excess heat on top of this. Ti figure out why Gas Giants show this, and terrestrial planets do not, let's think about the energy that was released by the gravitational collapse of the disc in to the planets, and how long it should take for bodies to dissipate this heat:\n",

    "So, the bigger the planets radius, the longer it takes for it dissipate all of the heat due to contraction. This is the Kelvin-Helmoholtz mechanism. Given this, we would expect Jupiter to still be contracting due to the it's formation.\n",

    "So if Jupiter's measured power output per unit area is 7.5 W/m$^2$, then we get a change in radius of $1$mm/year, which we are not sensitive to!\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupiter's heat production can be explained in this way - that is, the excess we see matches what we'd expect from this cooling time for an object of Jupiter's radius. However, Saturn's heat production is too high.\n",
    "- The most likely explanation is that the excess heat in Saturn is generated through the action of the virial theorem continus as He sinks slowly through the H$_2$ atmosphere."

    "In order to fully test any theory of planet formation, we have to rely on finding exoplanets (as observations of the solar system can only tell us about the current state). So let's talk about the issues with finding exoplanets before continuing. To start, imagine we were on a planet orbiting our nearest neighbour, Proxima Centauri (1.3 pc  ($=270,000$ AU)  away), and we wanted to try and detect Jupiter around the Sun. The maximum angular separation between Jupiter and the Sun as seen from Proxima Cen would be\n",
