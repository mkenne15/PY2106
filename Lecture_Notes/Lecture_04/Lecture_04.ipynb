    "We've seen that gravity is well behaved and easy to deal with when we are only considering 2 objects, and that analytic expressions exist for the separation between the bodies $r(\\theta)$, and both the kinetic and potential energies of the bodies.

As such, when studying many body systems (galaxies, star clusters, planetary rings), we need statistical tools which can give us physical insight into the systems.\n",
