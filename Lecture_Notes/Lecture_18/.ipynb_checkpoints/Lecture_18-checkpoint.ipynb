    "This shows that the velocity tends towards some near constant value the further out we go. This suggests that the $M$ enclosed must be increasing proportionally to $R$. This is at odds with the luminosities of these regions, as the lminosity of galaxies drops off very quickly with radius. Thus, whatever matter is being enclosed must be dark - thus, **dark matter**. There are a few candidates for particles that fit the required effects of dark matter, but we won't discuss them here."

    "The first attempt to classify galaxies into distinct types was done by Edwin Hubble, who separated the classes by morphology. In his scheme, there are three main classifications: **elliptical**, **spiral**, and **irregular**. Below shows a typical tuning fork diagram, which shows how the classes are related to each other. (Credit: NASA & ESA). The main limitation of this scheme is that it's restricted to very luminious galaxies, as these are the ones which Hubble could see.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hubble ordered the galaxies in this direction as he assumed that galaxies form as ellipticals and gradually evolve to spirals (which turns out to be wrong...)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ellipticals\n",
    "Elliptical galaxies are smooth, elliptical blobs with no evidence for dust lanes within them. Assuming they are ellipses, then their shape (semimajor and semiminor axes) can be described by one of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The axis ratio $q=b/a$\n",
    "* The ellipticity $\\varepsilon = 1- q$\n",
    "* The eccentricity $e = (1-q^2)^{1/2}$ of the galaxy. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, Hubble labelled elliptical galaxies as E**n**, where n was 10 times the ellipticity (so 0 was circular, 7 is highly elliptical). The surface brightness of elliptical galaxies goes as\n",

    "   \\log I \\propto -r^{1/4}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spirals\n",
    "Spiral galaxies have (obviously) spiral arms, which are most easily seen when the systems are viewed face on. The first person to note the spiral structure of these Galaxies was Lord Rosse using the Leviathan of Parsonstown (in Birr). Every spiral galaxy has a bulge, a rotating disc, and spiral arms within the disc (like the Milky Way). There are 3 principle classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sa: large bulge, tightly wound arms, little gas or dust.\n",
    "* Sb: medium bulge, moderately wound arms, some amounts of gas or dust.\n",
    "* Sc: small bulge, lossely wound spiral arms, lots of gas and dust.\n",

    "Additionally, if there is a very obvious bar running across the galaxy, then the classification becomes SB. The surface brightness follows the relation\n",

    "    \\log I \\propto -r\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Irregular\n",
    "These galaxies lack any regular shape. They are rich in gas, and have substantial amounts of ongoing star formation. The small magallenic cloud is such a galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dwarf galaxies\n",
    "Small, diffuse galaxies which are low in both surface brightness and total luminosity are not included in the above categories as they could not be seen with telescopes at the time Hubble was classifying galaxies. These **dwarf galaxies** are important, as it appears that, like with M dwarfs for stars, dwarf galaxies are the most common type of galaxy."
