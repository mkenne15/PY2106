    "Astrophysics is concerned with answering fundamental questions about the nature of the Universe. Answering these questions requires an understanding of classical mechanics (orbits), quantum mechanics (spectra)), thermodynamics (blackbodies), special relativity (distances to Galaxies), general relativity (cosmology/black holes), electromagnetism (polarisation/stellar structure), plasma physics (shocks/the Sun), condensed matter physics (neutron stars). As such, an astrophysicist needs to have a very wide knowledge base across all of the sub-disciplines of physics (while typically having a very deep knowledge on one field in particular).\n",
    "\n",
    "Astrophysicists must also have a good background in statistics and data analysis, since a lot of modern astrophysics requires analyse of observations or simulations. In particular, Bayesian statistics, where one implicitly states what their prior beliefs are, is very commong in modern research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently (and this is of course my own biased view), there are several fundamental questions which astrophysics is focused on answering:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compact object physics: How many black holes are there in the Universe, and what is the most general description of these objects? What is the equation of state of nuclear matter?\n",
    "* Cosmology: What is the fate of our Universe? How is this related to dark matter and energy in the Universe, and are the \"constants\" which dictate the Universe's future changing with time?\n",
    "* Stellar physics: How do stars form, and how quickly do they evolve through their various life stages?\n",
    "* Exoplanets: How many habitable planets are out there? What do we mean by habitable planets? Can we detect signatures of life in the atmospheres of these planets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that this is a 24 lecture course over 12 weeks, we are not going to be able to answer these questions, but we will be developing the foundations required to consider these questions We will focus on overviews of 6 rather general topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Orbital Mechanics.\n",
    "* Blackbody radiation, stars, and their spectra.\n",
    "* Planets and exoplanets.\n",
    "* Galaxies.\n",
    "* Cosmology.\n",
    "* Special Relativity.\n",
