    "## The Photosphere\n",
    "We've talked at length about how observational quantites (magnitude, distance, colour) can be translated into physical quantites (masses, radii, temperatures). However, in doing this, we never discussed what part of a star we are actually viewing when we take a spectrum, or take some photometry. It's important to figure this out. The goal of the first part of this lecture is to shed light (pun intended!) on this topic.\n",

    "\n",
    "When applying this to stars, it means that the inner parts of the star are optically thick, meaning we don't see the light coming from these regions. As you progress outwards from the Suns core, eventually either $n$ or $x$ become small enough that the optical depth drops below 1, in which case the medium becomes optically thin. It is from this region that light is emitted, and which we then observe with our telescopes. This region is called the photosphere. Now, let's use this information to understand both how large the photosphere is, and how this decides a stars luminosity class. \n",
